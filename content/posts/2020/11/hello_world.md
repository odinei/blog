### The beginning of a journey

I always wanted to have a website or blog, to post information about my learning journey through my Software Developer carrer, but I always struggled to choose the right technology stack.

During this process, I've played with:
* Wordpress + PHP + Mysql
* Joomla + PHP + Mysql
* BlogEngine + .NET + SQL Server

While I was figuring out the right tool, I've missed the moment and pace to build my blog. The year was 2010.

10 years have passed, and in the middle of the werdeist and endless year, I gave a new chance to myself and I've decided to build a new website/blog.

Checking the 2020 technologies, I found something really interesting, the fact that the tools available to build sites, to manage blogs are much simpler than 10 year ago! what a surprise! 

Considering this, I've decided that instead of using a heavy CMS to manage the content I would try an alternative to build a static website, and after a research and learning about the tools available, I've came up with the following tech stack:

* **Website Framework:** [Hugo]([https://gohugo.io/])
* **Theme:** [hello-friend-ng](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/) created by [Djordje Atlialp](https://github.com/rhazdon)
* **Hosting & Deployment:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
